#### Project Approach

- For this full-stack web application, I created the front end components and UI using Bootstrap, JavaScript, CSS & HTML. This involved creating the signin, register, navigation, header, main and footer components. 

- The next part was creating the backend of this project using django and involves creating an admin screen, registering the youtuber's detail in the postgresql database and later the data is sent to the member screen.
- The challenging part of this web app was to registing a user through google and facebook sign up through google and facebook apis.
